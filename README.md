# Hypothesis-testing
Hypothesis testing is the way of testing results of an experiment whether they are valid and meaningful and have not occured just by chance. If the results have happened just by chance then the experiment cannot be repeated and is not reusable. Please go though the assignments to get an idea about hypothesis testing.
